An intro to using Qiskit to implmement the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm

# Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm

QAOA is a way of solving really hard problems in a kinda close-but-not-perfect way. To do this, QAOA uses a special design called an "ansatz" that is made up of different parts that can be adjusted. Unlike some other methods, QAOA's ansatz is set up in a specific way that makes it work best. The only thing you really need to know is that there's a number called "reps" that determines how good the answer will be. The bigger the reps number, the better the answer will be (but also takes longer to solve).
